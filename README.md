# Free-fold-form
It has been awhile as I have been working helpdesk full-time for the last little while.
This is a refresh start into my coding journey. 
Starting with three.js
First goal is to build and deploy a simple dice rolling web application using three.js, css and html.
Next step will be to add a web page for each dice, D20 etc.
If time allows potentially add modifiers to rolls so anyone is able to use this from anywhere for free.
